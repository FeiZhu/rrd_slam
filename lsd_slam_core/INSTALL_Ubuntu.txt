RRD-SLAM should use OpenCV 2.4.8

therefore, build your own opencv 2.4.8 and install somewhere such that

/home/jaehak/Devel/share/OpenCV

After running

	$ rosmake

You will get errors but

	$ cd build
	$ ccmake ..

Then find OpenCV_CONFIG_PATH and OpenCV_DIR and change them

	OpenCV_CONFIG_PATH /home/jaehak/Devel/share/OpenCV
	OpenCV_DIR /home/jaehak/Devel/share/OpenCV

Then configure 'c' and generate 'g' makefile.

Then, build

	$ make VERBOSE=1 -j 24
